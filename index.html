      <p class="projectDescription">
        This React web application was developed for the semester project. The project focuses on combining three teams: frontend, backend, and IoT.

        The purpose of the project is to create web application for displaying temperature, humidity and Co2 levels in a greenhouse. It has also a feature for toggling and scheduling the water system and creating custom presets for vegetables with specific thresholds. This application is connected using REST to Backend part of the project, which is eventually communicating with real IoT sensors and servo motor.
      </p>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        Entire Greenhouse application consists of 3 projects, which are Frontend, Cloud and IoT. Each part was developed by specific sub-team and each sub-team consisted of 4 people. So, the entire applicatio was developed by 12 people. Each sub-team was actively communicating with each other and we used advanced SCRUM framework for large team, which is called LeSS framework.

    </div>

    <h1>Intent</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      Rack-Verify is an application that was developed as a Bachelor Project for company Schneider Electric in Denmark. The purpose of the project is to help operators in data centers who are already using software developed by Schneider Electric for modelling data centers. Such as software allows users to create a digital twin of devices in data centers such as servers, racks, rows, etc.
    </p>

    <p class="projectDescription">However, currently there isn't any tool that would allow operators to compare real devices in data centers with their digital representation. The only possible way is to compare them manually, which makes the process slow and there is still a huge chance of making a mistake. </p>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      We decided to create Rack-Verify mobile app that allows operators to capture photo of a Rack in data center and then is used machine learning model that is running on the backend for analyzing devices in the rack. On the frontend, the recognized devices are highlighted in the photo and visualized in a 2D Rack model.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">  
      The Rack-Verify was developed by 3 people. I was working on the frontend and 2 other guys were working on the backend and machine learning part. Frontend was developed by using React Native with Expo.

      <h1>Intent</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        This website was developed in student programming assosiation called BeCreative. Website was created for our client from Czech Republic, who wanted to create website for his apartment in Kasperky mountains to help him with marketing and attracting more tenants.
      </p>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        We were developing the project in team of 4 people. Our challanges were to manage group work and also to sometimes split the work. Project came through design part, developing part and deploying part. In design part we have learned how to use Figma more in depth. In development part, we wanted to challange ourselves and use VUE.js. It was for us new technology and we were learning as we were going. VUE.js and it's technology Vue i18n was very helpful, when we were implementing changing languages of the content. Vue also helped us with managing lifecycles and creating loading on the page. Vue was helpful, but at the same time most challanges and difficulties with which have encountered, where connected with this technology.
      </p>

      <h1>End Result</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        The result is website that from design part looks modern, minimalistic and modern. Website is fully functional, optimized, fast and is serving purpose of our client.

      <h1>About the project</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        The idea for the project came from the desire to contribute to solving the 17 Global Goals presented by the UN in 2015. One of them, the eleventh goal called "Sustainable cities and communities", forces the inhabitants of both cities and villages to reflect. In order for the world to prepare for the growing population of urbanized areas, it is necessary to look at and solve the problems that exist here now. 
      </p>
  
      <h1>Implementation</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        Photoguard is a distributed system with 3-tier architecture including: Client presentation tier, logic servers tier and data server tier with connection to the database. First tier is written in HTML, CSS, JS and C# using Blazor framework and it is connected to second tier by RESTful API sending and receiving JSON files. Server to host images in the second tier is written in C# using Web API. App logic server is written in C#, but also communicates with third tier using gRPC framework which uses Protocol Buffers. Third tier data server is written in Java and communicates with PostgreSQL database with JDBC. Additionally, system uses Google Maps API.

    <h1>Intent</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
     I wanted to create something unique and stand out from the crowd. My intention was to create portfolio which I believe nobody saw before. I was partialy inspired by  <a href="https://peteroravec.com/" target="blank" class="oravec">amazing portfolio</a> of Peter Oravec, who is also from Slovakia as me and had the same idea to show his work in playful and unique way.
    </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      From my video production experience I had good knowledge about paralax effects, so theory behind them was for me easy. However implemenation was a bit challenging. It was done by using Gsap scroll trigger animations with the help of motion path plugin.
    </p>

    <h1>End Result</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      The project met my expectations, and I hope you like it too. I believe that my personal goal which is to get hired as a front-end developer will be accomplished thanks to this portfolio.
    </p>
    <h1>Future of the Project</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
    I KNOW ABOUT MANY ERRORS which are visible in this website. This project will be in the constant development. Right now is in version 1. Next version will be also for mobile devices and tablets and will fix many errors. Also as I'm constantly working on new projects, they will be added to my portfolio website.
