      <h1>Intent</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        This website was developed in student programming assosiation called BeCreative. Website was created for our client from Czech Republic, who wanted to create website for his apartment in Kasperky mountains to help him with marketing and attracting more tenants.
      </p>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        We were developing the project in team of 4 people. Our challanges were to manage group work and also to sometimes split the work. Project came through design part, developing part and deploying part. In design part we have learned how to use Figma more in depth. In development part, we wanted to challange ourselves and use VUE.js. It was for us new technology and we were learning as we were going. VUE.js and it's technology Vue i18n was very helpful, when we were implementing changing languages of the content. Vue also helped us with managing lifecycles and creating loading on the page. Vue was helpful, but at the same time most challanges and difficulties with which have encountered, where connected with this technology.
      </p>

      <h1>End Result</h1>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        The result is website that from design part looks modern, minimalistic and modern. Website is fully functional, optimized, fast and is serving purpose of our client.

    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      The idea for the project came from the desire to contribute to solving the 17 Global Goals presented by the UN in 2015. One of them, the eleventh goal called "Sustainable cities and communities", forces the inhabitants of both cities and villages to reflect. In order for the world to prepare for the growing population of urbanized areas, it is necessary to look at and solve the problems that exist here now. 
    </p>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      Photoguard is a distributed system with 3-tier architecture including: Client presentation tier, logic servers tier and data server tier with connection to the database. First tier is written in HTML, CSS, JS and C# using Blazor framework and it is connected to second tier by RESTful API sending and receiving JSON files. Server to host images in the second tier is written in C# using Web API. App logic server is written in C#, but also communicates with third tier using gRPC framework which uses Protocol Buffers. Third tier data server is written in Java and communicates with PostgreSQL database with JDBC. Additionally, system uses Google Maps API.

    <h1>Intent</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      The project was created to automate the process of renting ski equipment. There are many rentals that allow customers to book services or equipment that they offer online, but members of our group have not met with a winter sports equipment rental that allows the customer to rent skis through the online system.
    </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      Software was created using Java and along with using several libraries. GUI was made with help of JavaFx library. This allows easier creating and modifying of GUI. For manipulating with database using Java and accessing data from database through PostgreSQL was used JDBC, Java database connectivity. Thanks to MVVM, software is divided into packages with single-responsibility and splitted into model, view-model and model. This structure was useful for following SOLID.
    </p>

    <h1>End Result</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      From user point of view, system not only satisfies every requirement, but it also involve several extra features. The system can save images to the database and then display them properly in the application. Also, user can pick exact dates for which the reservation should be placed. From programmer point of view, the system was tested using white-box and black-box approach. System also uses number of design patterns, thanks to what it is simply extendable and easy to manage in future.

    <h1>Intent</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      The project was made for purpose to simplify the process of creating a schedule, displaying the schedule on to a website. Both administrator and users have user-friendly GUI for accessing or doing relevant actions for their rolls. Waterfall methodology was used for developing this project, keeping the work consistent and optimizing the workflow.
    </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      Technology used for the system was mandatory. The system was created using Java for logic in the background and GUI. For GUI was also used JavaFX library and Scene builder for easier navigations. Website was designed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework. Functionality on the website was created using JavaScript and Glider.js for schedule.
    </p>

    <h1>End Result</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      The result was a system that has user-friendly GUI that is quick to navigate, easy to understand and able to do most of the required functionality. Being more specific, 17 of 19 requirements are covered which confirms that the system is working correctly. Administrator can quickly change or add new lessons while the students have an easy access to all that information online on the web. The website, including its design, was also, made in order that provide access to view schedule as quickly and as clearly as it is possible. As result, teachers and students are able to find information about the study program, courses, the school and the schedule which is the crucial element.

    <h1>Intent</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
     I wanted to create something unique and stand out from the crowd. My intention was to create portfolio which I believe nobody saw before. I was partialy inspired by  <a href="https://peteroravec.com/" target="blank" class="oravec">amazing portfolio</a> of Peter Oravec, who is also from Slovakia as me and had the same idea to show his work in playful and unique way.
    </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      From my video production experience I had good knowledge about paralax effects, so theory behind them was for me easy. However implemenation was a bit challenging. It was done by using Gsap scroll trigger animations with the help of motion path plugin.
    </p>

    <h1>End Result</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
     I believe that project satisfied by expectations and is ready for deployment. I hope that my personal goal which was to help me hired as internship front-end developer will be accomplished thanks to this portfolio.
    </p>
    <h1>Future of the Project</h1>
    <p class="projectDescription">
    I KNOW ABOUT MANY ERRORS which are visible in this website. This project will be in the constant development. Right now (Februar,2023) is in version 1. Next version will be also for mobile devices and tablets and will fix many errors. Also as I'm constantly working on new projects, they will be added to my portfolio website.
